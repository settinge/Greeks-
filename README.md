# Movie Score Looping

## Details

* Given a list of movie scores, I determined how many good, ok and bad movies there were.

* Added scores over 7 to the `goodMovies` array.

* Added scores between 5 and 7 to the `okMovies` array.

* Added the rest of the scores to the the `badMovies` array.

* Calculated the average rating for all of the movies.
