# Movie Score Looping

## Details

* Given a list of movie scores, I determined how many good, ok and bad movies there were.

* Created a for loop to go through the `movieScore` list.

* Added scores over 7 to the `goodMovies` array.

* Added scores between 5 and 7 to the `okMovies` array.

* Added the rest of the scores to the the `badMovies` array.

* Calculated the average rating for all of the movies.

* Printed out how many good, ok and bad movies there were and what the overall total score was
  to the console.
